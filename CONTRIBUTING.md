## How to contribute

Help from community is necessary to make any opensource project great. We want to keep it as easy as possible for community to contribute changes. There are a few guidlines that we need to follow so that it is easy for others to understand and change the codebase.

### Getting Started
* Install Hugo. You can follow [this link](https://gohugo.io/installation/). 
* Now, you have Hugo installed. Clone the source code from [github](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/openprinting.github.io).
* Go to the directory and run:
```
hugo server
```
* If you want to access website from some other device on local network, use:
```
hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0
```
* Open ``` localhost:1313 ```

### Issues
* If you want to work on some issue, first comment on that issue that you want to work.
* If you want to open a new Issue. First make sure similiar issue is not present.
* In case of a bug, always mention browser you are using because different browsers may behave differently.
* In case of an Idea, please mention how it will change user experience and/or how it will enhance functionality of the website.

### Pull Requests
* If you have made some changes in the codebase and want to generate a PR. First, pull latest version of code from [upstream](https://github.com/Esri/developer-support/wiki/Setting-the-upstream-for-a-fork). Remove all merge conflicts before generating PR.
* In the PR, try to add working link of your work and if that is not possible, add screenshots.

### Making changes
* Whenever you are working on some major feature, always create a [new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging). 
* Whenever you add something above trivial, please add comments.
