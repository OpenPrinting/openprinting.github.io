title: "Wrapping proprietary printer drivers into a Printer Application"
---

### Introduction
<p>
With sandboxed packaging, Linux distributions appear which do not use classic RPM or DEB packages any more, like the all-Snap Ubuntu Core. As a result CUPS will not work with classic PPD/filter-based printer drivers any more but requires all drivers being provided as Printer Applications. The student's task is to add this functionality to the Printer Application framework and create an easy way for users to install proprietary printer drivers into that chroot-equipped Printer Application.
