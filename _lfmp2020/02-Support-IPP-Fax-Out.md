title: "Support for IPP Fax Out"
---

### Introduction
<p>
IPP Fax out is a feature which is currently missing in Linux unlike Print and Scan. The student's task here is to make this functionality easily accessible for users of common desktop Linux distributions. Like printers, faxes should automatically appear on the system and get available in print dialogs and if one prints to a fax, fax-specific options should also appear in the print dialog and the user should be able to pick phone numbers also from contacts.
