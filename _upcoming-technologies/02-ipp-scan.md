title: IPP scan (or virtual MF device) server (Scanner Application)
---
IPP-Scan is an extension of the existing IPP protocol to facilitate driverless scanning. Currently, to scan in linux, a user has to procure the device specific SANE driver and then use a command line or a GUI based application that communicates with that scanner using this driver. Using IPP-Scan, a client would be able to communicate and receive files from an IPP-Scan enabled scanner using a universal IPP-Scan SANE backend or more directly through libcups, thus eliminating the need of maintaining scanner specific drivers. 
However, currently there are no IPP-Scan scanners in the market. Scanner Application attempts to remedy this situation by connecting to ordinary scanners and then emulating the IPPScan versions of them. The clients can now communicate with the Scanner Application as if they were communicating with an IPP-Scan scanner. This provides us with two major benefits, firstly we move all the drivers to the central scan service rather than keeping a copy of each driver on each client (driverless scanning) and secondly, developers can now distribute a sandbox package of all scanner drivers.
