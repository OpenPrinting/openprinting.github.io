At OpenPrinting we are full steam in the preparations for the Google Summer of Code 2025! Everybody in our team was looking for what we will do next and what can make up an exciting GSoC project ...

We ended up with a list of 15 project ideas, of a wide variety of areas: Desktop, security, PDF rendering, and even the automated recognition of the graphical content of a rasterized page.

We have already started looking for contributors end of last year, and many enthusiastic contributor candidates are already chatting with us, watching our videos, reading our introductions, studying our code, doing onboarding exercises ...

... and they are eagerly waiting for the project ideas we will post for this year. And here we go, with our [official GSoC 2025 project idea list](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2025-openprinting-projects).

And this is a quick overview of what we are offering:
