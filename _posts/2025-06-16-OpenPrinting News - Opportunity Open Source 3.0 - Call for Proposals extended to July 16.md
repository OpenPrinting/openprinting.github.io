We are currently in the middle of the preparations for another awesome [Opportunity Open Source](https://oosc3ubucon.netlify.app/), this time co-located with the first UbuCon India. We have already reserved the space in the IIT Kanpur (where we have also been last year), lined up a volunteer team for all the on-location organization work, contacted potential sponsors and potential speakers, announced the event on several platforms, ...

But the most important is to deliver amazing content: Talks, workshops, panel sessions, demos tables/booths, and ...

**Meet-ups and BoFs**

This year we accept meet-ups and BoF sessions as a new session format and plane to make available an extra room for them.

This way you can meet for informal discussions, like for example planning Ubuntu community activity in India, working out a new free software application project, establishing free software use in schools or public administration, ...

It is also a chance for leading developers of an open-source project coming from overseas and meeting their Indian developer community.

And, as we are always dealing with free and open-source software anybody is highly welcome to join these sessions, learn about the work of free software organiations and getting involved ...

But, was there not already the submission deadline today? Yes, but we have extended it by one month, to give you enough time for planning. The [**Call for Proposals**](https://events.canonical.com/event/134/abstracts/) is now open until

**Wednesday, July 16, 11:59pm IST (18:29 UTC)**

So we are eager to see your proposals.
