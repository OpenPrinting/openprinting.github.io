excerpt: We will just run the OOSC, as last year, without UbuCon ... And we need more session proposals ...

Unfortunately, due to some unavoidable circumstances we are not having a joint event. Therefore, we will have the Opportunity Open Source, as originally planned, **on September 5-7 in the IIT Kanpur, but without UbuCon India**. We will focus, as in the first two editions, in 2023 and 2024, on introducing students, and also professors and researchers, at universities and colleges in India.

**Your proposals for talks, workshops, meet-ups, BoFs, booths, demos ...**

An important part of a conference is that we convey great content, for attendees to learn what one can do with free and open source software and how to contribute to it. As in the previous editions we will have talks and lightning talks, both from in-person and remote speakers, and interactive hands-on workshops, where attendees can try out and experience the subject matter on their own laptops.

But we also accept informal meet-ups and BoFs, where a leader in an open source project can meet the local community and, by the session being open for everyone, give insight into the project to people who like to contribute.

And to stimulate the hallway track we are looking for booths and demo tables, to show off your open-source work and motivate people to participate.

So please post your ideas on our [Call for Proposals](https://events.canonical.com/event/134/abstracts/), until

**Wednesday, July 16, 11:59pm IST (18:29 UTC)**

We are eager to see your contributions.
