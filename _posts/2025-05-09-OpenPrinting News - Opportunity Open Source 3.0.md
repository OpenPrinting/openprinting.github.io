After two great Opportunity Open Source conferences we go into the third round!

## IIT Kanpur

With the success we had [last year in the IIT Kanpur](/OpenPrinting-News-August-2024/#opportunity-open-source-in-iit-kanpur), especially also because of the great on-location organization team of the IIT Kanpur (thanks again), and them having offered to us to organize the conference again, we have decided to [do it in Kanpur a second time](https://oosc3ubucon.netlify.app/). Sanskar Yaduka and Shreya Shree, students at the IIT Kanpur are leading the on-location organization, setting up a team of volunteers and looking for local sponsors.

As in the other years we want to motivate students (and also professors and researchers) to learn about free and open-source software and to join the community of developers and contributors. Not only coding and debugging can be contributed, but also designers, technical authors, evangelists, ... are highly welcome.

## Ubuntu meets Opportunity Open Source

Last year, we had the Opportunity Open Source one week before the [UbuCon Asia 2024](/OpenPrinting-News-August-2024/#ubucon-asia-2024-in-india) which had taken place in Jaipur, also in India. Having people of the Indian Ubuntu community organizing the event and also others attending it, they decided to reactivate the [Ubuntu Local Community (LoCo) India](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/170). Bhavanishankar Ravindra ("Bhavi") and [Soumyadeep Ghosh](/OpenPrinting-News-August-2024/#soumyadeep-ghosh) are currently leading these efforts.

They also want to have an [UbuCon](https://ubucon.org/) India conference and I suggested to co-locate it with the upcoming Opportunity Open Source, as many UbuCons are co-located ([UbuCon North America on SCaLE](https://ubucon.org/scale), [UbuCon Portugal on Festa do Software Livre](/OpenPrinting-News-October-2024/#festa-do-software-livreubucon-portugal-2024), [UbuCon Europe on OpenSouthCode](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/57060), ...), they accepted my suggestion, and we started planning ...

Canonical also offered to sponsor a conference in India, Opportunity Open Source or UbuCon India, and now with the co-location both.

Setting the date for our event right one week after the [UbuCon Asia 2025 in Kathmandu, Nepal](https://2025.ubucon.asia/) we can have some speakers doing the Nepal/India round trip and this way enrich our event with more international speakers.

## Call for Proposals is open

But to make the event really great, we need your contributions: Talks, panels, workshops, demo tables, lightning talks ... Show us how you are contributing to free and open-source software, how you make our lifes better with it, You do not need to be a coder. also sessions about documentation, design, community, success stories, ... are highly welcome.

**Our [Call for Proposals](https://events.canonical.com/event/134/abstracts/) is open! Until June 16, 2025!**

So please post your proposals. We (and also our attendees) are eager to have your contribution on our conference.

Please pay special attention to the new "UbuCon India" track. Your Ubuntu-related submissions to here will make up the first UbuCon India.

## Let us celebrate a great event!

We will again have many sessions about OpenPrinting, Zephyr, Google Summer of Code, Snap, ... Many workshops and this time also several Ubuntu-related ones. We also want to have some demo tables, where things can be tried out hands-on and conversations will fuel an exciting hallway track. And if it works out, we will also offer a Hackathon again.

Also, this time, we are not coinciding with any exam periods at The IIT Kanpur and so expect significanly more attendeeds as last year. And the first UbuCon India will also attract people from other places all over the country.

**We hope to see you all in India ...**
