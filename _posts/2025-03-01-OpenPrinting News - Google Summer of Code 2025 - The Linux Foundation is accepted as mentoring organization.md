Now it is official and we do not need to tell any more to any interested contributor candidate "If we get accepted ...". We welcome contributors for OpenPrinting for the 17th time now!

Already near the end of 2024, well before applying as mentoring organization for 2025, even before all of our GSoC 2024 projects have been completed, we have already watched out for contributors for this year, giving them onboarding materials, first assignments, talked about our fields of work with them ...

[A month ago](/OpenPrinting-News-Google-Summer-of-Code-2025-Project-Ideas-List-posted/), before the application window for mentoring organizations opened, we published our [project ideas list](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2025-openprinting-projects).

This brought in another bunch of people contacting us to express that they want to get a GSoC contributor in our organization, some have even brought their own idea.

If you like to participate in the GSoC as a contributor for OpenPrinting, please contact us ASAP (contact info below and on the project idea list) and do not wait for the official application window. We need to know you and your skills, we need to involve you in our developer community, we also will help you to write your proposal, ... If you just post a proposal without contacting us before, your chances to get selected are not very high ...

We also need mentors, if you like to help us mentoring our contributors please tell us and also which projects/areas you want to mentor for.

So please speak up and be a part of an amazing GSoC with us!
