excerpt: CUPS 2.4.16 hot fix release is available
---

The hotfix release 2.4.16 includes fix for infinite loop in GTK, which was caused by change of internal behavior in libcups on which GTK depended on, and workaround for stopping the scheduler if configuration includes unknown directives.

The full list of changes is shown in CHANGES.md.

Enjoy!
