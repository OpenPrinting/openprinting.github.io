---
On Tuesday our annual meeting will start again. During 4 days we will discuss our plans how we will continue the development printing (and scanning) with free software on Linux and similar operating systems and also about free printing-related standards, especially the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).

The OpenPrinting-related part is the first day (Tue, May 5). See the [agenda](http://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/may-2020-virtual.html).

Due to COVID-19 we will not meet in person, but have a virtual meeting, using WebEx. The agenda was modified to make the individual meeting days shorter, adding a forth day.

Everyone can participate, we do not discuss anything secret or proprietary. There is also no registration nor any conference fees needed.

Simply have a look on the [agenda and logistics page](http://www.pwg.org/chair/meeting-info/may-2020-virtual.html). Slides of all presentations are linked there, too, at latest before the appropriate presentation starts.

To participate in the WebEx meeting, please [e-mail to the PWG chair](mailto:chair@pwg.org) at any time before or during the meeting, and visit the [WebEx meeting page](https://ieee-isto.webex.com/ieee-isto/j.php?MTID=me6d5c9007b21df65665da7d3f262a845).
