Many of you know the YouTuber **Brodie Robertson**, mostly by his main channel, just named [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/@BrodieRobertson) where he is talking about and discussing the latest news and incidents in the FOSS world (ex.: "[Can't print on Tuesdays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6fPfwixNLk)") and often causing controversial discussions in the comment sections.

But he has also a second channel, [Tech over Tea](https://www.youtube.com/@TechOverTea/videos), where he does, once a week, an interview with a person who is doing important things for free and open source software.

Back in April this year, Brodie had [posted on Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@BrodieOnLinux/114259839866977303) asking for nominating potential guests for future episodes of Tech over Tea. I had taken that opportunity then and sent an e-mail to Brodie:

> I have seen now that you are asking for nominations for guests in "Tech over Tea" on Mastodon. And I know that the person who is leading OpenPrinting is one of these project developers interested to be guest in your show. So I am nominating him with this e-mail, yes myself. ...

He liked the idea and accepted my offer and we aimed for producing and publishing the show before the northern-hemisphere summer holidays. Unfortunately, in May, the [incident with Canonical](#why-did-canonical-part-with-the-leader-of-linux-printing) happened and I did not know how things with me and with OpenPrinting will go on in the future, and in this situation I did not want to give the interview, so I asked for postponing the production until the issue gets sorted out ...

... when I got the [investment of the Sovereign Tech Agency](/OpenPrinting-News-Sovereign-Tech-Agency-is-investing-in-OpenPrinting/) and so being mostly recovered, I mailed to Brodie again and told him that I am now ready for producing the video, aiming for publication well before the end-of-year holidays. So we did it and it came out great!

I got many likes and some questions on the social media where I linked the videos and on the videos themselves on YouTube. I answered all the questions, liked many a and disliked a few comments, and I also got a lot of likes for that, also from Brodie.

**Have fun watching the interview (below) and feel free to comment and ask your questions in the YouTube comments ...**

## Highlight clips

Is watching/listening to a full 2-hour Tech over Tea episode not your cup of tea?

Do not run for a coffee now to keep yourself awake for the 2 hours, but just watch the most breaking news in it which Brodie has separated for you, as usual one on each of the 6 days after the release of the full episode.

### Why Did Canonical Part With The Leader Of Linux Printing

The first of them is about the incident with Canonical and how I am recovering, and fairly well (thanks again, [Sovereign Tech Agency](/OpenPrinting-News-Sovereign-Tech-Agency-is-investing-in-OpenPrinting/)) as I am covered until end-2026 now!
