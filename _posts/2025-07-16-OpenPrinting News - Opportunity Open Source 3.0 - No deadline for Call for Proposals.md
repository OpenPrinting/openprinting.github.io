The [Opportunity Open Source](https://oosc3ubucon.netlify.app/) comes closer, but after our first extension of the deadline for the [Call for Proposals](https://events.canonical.com/event/134/abstracts/) we still have a lot free space in our schedule.

Therefore **we do not stop our Call for Proposals at all, but leave it just open**. We will **start accepting session proposals in the next days** and do a preliminary schedule at the end of this month/beginning of next month, and we will keep our eyes on new proposals and accept them when they are interesting. So last-minute proposals are welcome.

We will have a room for talks, a room for workshops, and a room for BoFs. If one of them runs full, we consider putting some sessions of that type into one of the other rooms. We also consider closing the CfP should we get too many proposals. So do not wait too long with your submission to secure your spot.

So we are eager to see your amazing content: Talks, workshops, panel sessions, demos tables/booths, BoFs/meet-ups, ...

**Here is our [Call for Proposals](https://events.canonical.com/event/134/abstracts/).**

see you all in Kanpur ...
