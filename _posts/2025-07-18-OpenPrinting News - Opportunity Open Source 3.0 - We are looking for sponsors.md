excerpt: No conference without solid support - Wide range of sponsorship packages available
---
The [Opportunity Open Source](https://oosc3ubucon.netlify.app/) is not only an awesome conference because of its speakers, or its audience, but also because of its sponsors. Without them, the event would not be possible, or at least not such a success ...

Last year's sponsors did not only cover the costs of the beautiful posters announcing the event with all its speakers, the schedules, and all information handy for the attendees, and the accommodation of speakers in the guest house, but also an unforgettable conference dinner/closing party.

They also have supported the hackathon, not only covering costs but also providing problem statements.

And this year [we are looking for sponsors](https://oosc3ubucon.netlify.app/sponsors) again, and to make sponsoring easier, we offer a variety of sponsorship packages. Depending on the amount you provide to us, you get valuable perks: Visibility of your logo, getting mentioned in announcements, but also exhibition booths, stage time for talks an workshops, the opportunity to provide a problem statement for the hackathon, ...
