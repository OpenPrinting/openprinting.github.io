CUPS is the standards-based, open source printing system for UNIXÂ®-like
operating systems.  CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) to support
printing to local and network printers.  The OpenPrinting CUPS project includes
bugs fixes and improvements that are not part of the
[Apple CUPS project](https://www.cups.org/).
