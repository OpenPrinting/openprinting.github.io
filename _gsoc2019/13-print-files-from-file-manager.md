title: Printing of files directly from the file manager
---

### Introduction

<p>
Sometimes you browse through your files and see some files which you want to print, files in completely different formats: PDFs, photos, LibreOffice files, … It is awkward to double-click each file, one-by-one, to get it opened in its application, and then click “Print” in each application. It would be much easier to mark all these files, right-click and then click “Print” in the context menu.
