ipptool is a command line tool for issuing IPP requests and receiving printer&#039;s/server&#039;s responses.  ipptool is maintained as free software in the ippsample collection from the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group (PWG). ipptool is used for development and debugging of IPP-related software and for PWG self-certification for IPP Everywhere printers for driverless printing.
