title: Get the cairo color management code upstream
---

<div>

<p>
Adrian Johnson did a lot of the work needed to make cairo color managed. Finishing this work and getting the code upstream would allow us to simplify a lot of applications that use cairo. See <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/%7Eajohnson/cairo/log/?h=color-space" title="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/%7Eajohnson/cairo/log/?h=color-space"  rel="nofollow">http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~ajohnson/cairo/log/?h=color-space</a> for the branch. Adrian has also patched Inkscape to use the new features, and that needs cleaning up and pushing upstream <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/%7Eajohnson/inkscape/log/?h=color-space" title="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/%7Eajohnson/inkscape/log/?h=color-space"  rel="nofollow">http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~ajohnson/inkscape/log/?h=color-space</a> Also see <a href="http://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2012-July/023353.html" title="http://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2012-July/023353.html"  rel="nofollow">http://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2012-July/023353.html</a> and <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-developer-list/2012-August/msg00084.html" title="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-developer-list/2012-August/msg00084.html"  rel="nofollow">https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-developer-list/2012-August/msg00084.html</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
Expectations: The cairo and inskcape code is pushed upstream with any required modifications. Ideally someone familiar with the cairo community would take this on, as Adrian found it hard to get the code approved upstream.
</p>

<p>
Skills: Understanding of basic color management, basic use of bzr and git, proficient in C.
